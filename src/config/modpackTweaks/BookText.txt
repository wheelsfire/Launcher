**This is the file that Modpack Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Want to smelt just one item?~
~
Think using coal for it is a waste?~
~
Worry no more! Just lightly tap a piece of coal or charcoal with a Carpenter's Hammer to break it into small pieces!~
~~~
§nPSA: Obsidian Ingots§r~
~
Obsidian ingots that come out of a smeltery are simply too impure to be used in the production of machines.~
~
The Obsidian dust will have to be purified and refined before it is fit for use in mechanisms.
